# VOICE-FE

## Abstract

Our team introduces 'VOICE', a multimodal smart home configuration and management application that leverages Speech-to-Intent (STI) technology and text-based interactions. VOICE aims to revolutionize the daily lives of busy modern individuals by making smart home systems more intuitive and efficient.

VOICE enables users to easily register and manage home appliances through a user-friendly interface. The 'AI's Pick' feature, in particular, provides optimal routines tailored to the user's situation. This feature utilizes a model trained on tens of thousands of routines generated by ChatGPT, analyzing user input and context to suggest customized routines.

Furthermore, through integration with AI speakers, VOICE offers the ability to recommend and execute routines via voice commands. It also includes an innovative approach where the speaker continuously monitors conversations to proactively suggest routines appropriate to the situation. VOICE's multimodal analysis technology not only understands words but also analyzes voice tone and speed to comprehend hidden emotions and context when recommending routines.

By combining a text-based generative AI model with voice recognition technology, VOICE recommends optimal routines for a wide variety of situations, allowing smart home technology to blend more naturally into users' daily lives. Our goal is to increase the accessibility and utilization of smart home technology across all age groups through VOICE.

This project aims to create smart home systems using an intuitive user interface and natural voice interactions, leveraging technology to enhance accessibility and ease of use. In particular, the AI-based personalized routine recommendation feature provides an optimized smart home experience tailored to users' living patterns without complex settings. This will make daily life more convenient for a wide range of users, from the elderly to younger generations.
