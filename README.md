# VOICE-FE

####abstract
Abstract—Our team introduces ‘VOICE’, a multimodal smart
home configuration and management application that leverages
Speech-to-Intent (STI) technology and text-based interactions.
VOICE aims to revolutionize the daily lives of busy modern
individuals by making smart home systems more intuitive and
efficient.
VOICE enables users to easily register and manage home
appliances through a user-friendly interface. The ’AI’s Pick’
feature, in particular, provides optimal routines tailored to the
user’s situation. This feature utilizes a model trained on tens
of thousands of routines generated by ChatGPT, analyzing user
input and context to suggest customized routines. Furthermore,
through integration with AI speakers, VOICE offers the ability
to recommend and execute routines via voice commands. It also
includes an innovative approach where the speaker continuously
monitors conversations to proactively suggest routines appropri-
ate to the situation. VOICE’s multimodal analysis technology not
only understands words but also analyzes voice tone and speed to
comprehend hidden emotions and context when recommending
routines.
By combining a text-based generative AI model with voice
recognition technology, VOICE recommends optimal routines for
a wide variety of situations, allowing smart home technology
to blend more naturally into users’ daily lives. Our goal is to
increase the accessibility and utilization of smart home technology
across all age groups through VOICE. This project aims to create
smart home systems using an intuitive user interface and natural
voice interactions, leveraging technology to enhance accessibility
and ease of use. In particular, the AI-based personalized routine
recommendation feature provides an optimized smart home
experience tailored to users’ living patterns without complex
settings. This will make daily life more convenient for a wide
range of users, from the elderly to younger generations.
